This project (A gradle nightmare) contains:
- A Paper plugin that aims to add various science fiction mechanics to
Minecraft.
- A QOL Fabric mod to pair with said plugin.

Overall it's a ~~somewhat~~ very cursed mess of WIP code. 

Originally a fork of
PeterCrawley's [Minecraft Starship Plugin](https://github.com/peter-crawley/minecraft-starship-plugin)  
Uses some code from [Horizon's End](https://github.com/horizonsendmc/)'s OldIon codebase, as well as some code
from [AP Dev Team's Movecraft](https://github.com/APDevTeam/Movecraft/) both licensed under GPL-3.
